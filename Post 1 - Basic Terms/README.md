# 📘 DSA Series – Day 2  
## 🔹 Basic Terms in DSA  

In this post, we’ll understand some **fundamental terms** that form the foundation of Data Structures & Algorithms, along with **daily-life relatable examples**.

### ⚡ Algorithm  
📖 **Definition**: A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.  

🧩 **Daily Life Example**:  
Making **tea** 🍵 is an algorithm:  
1. Boil water  
2. Add tea leaves  
3. Add sugar & milk  
4. Strain and serve  

Just like this, algorithms in coding are precise steps to solve a problem.

### 📦 Data Structure  
📖 **Definition**: A way to **organize and store data** efficiently.  

🧩 **Daily Life Example**:  
Think of your **wardrobe** 👕👗:  
- Shirts in one section  
- Pants in another  
- Accessories in a drawer  

Because your clothes are organized, you can find them quickly. Similarly, data structures help us organize information for fast and efficient access.

### ⏱️ Time Complexity  
📖 **Definition**: A measure of **how fast an algorithm runs**.  

🧩 **Daily Life Example**:  
Finding your friend’s number in your phone:  
- **Brute force (O(n))** → Scroll through the entire list one by one.  
- **Efficient search (O(log n))** → Use the search bar and type a few letters to find instantly.  

The difference between scrolling vs searching is **time complexity**.

### 💾 Space Complexity  
📖 **Definition**: A measure of **how much memory an algorithm uses**.  

🧩 **Daily Life Example**:  
Remembering your grocery list 🛒:  
- Method 1: Remember everything in your head → Almost no extra space.  
- Method 2: Write the list on one paper → Some memory used.  
- Method 3: Write each item on sticky notes → A lot more memory used.  

Choosing wisely between these methods is like managing **space complexity**.

### 🔁 Recursion (Bonus)  
📖 **Definition**: A method where a **function calls itself** to solve a smaller version of the same problem.  

🧩 **Daily Life Example**:  
Standing between **two mirrors facing each other**:  
- You see your reflection inside another reflection, and so on → infinite loop.  
- But in recursion, we define a **base case** (like the mirror fading out) to stop the infinite loop.

## ✅ Key Takeaways  
- These are the **building blocks of DSA**.  
- You’ll encounter them in almost every coding problem.  
- Mastering them early makes your DSA journey smooth 🚀
